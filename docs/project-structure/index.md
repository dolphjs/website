# Project strcuture

This is basically the folder and file structure for a dolphjs project. After running the `dolph-cli new <project>` command, you must have noticed a generated project with the struture below:

```r
.
├─ src
├─ .gitignore
├─ .swrcr
├─ .dolph_config.yaml
├─ .dolph-cli.yaml
├─ package.json
├─ tsconfig.json
```

::: info
the folder structure assumes you choosed typescript as project language. However, structure for javascript isn't much different except for the absent of the .swrcr file
