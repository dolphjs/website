# Why

There are several pretty decent Node.js frameworks out there, and you might be wondering: why should I use this one? Apparently, dolph has it's uniqueness which includes:

- Enforcing code styles and implementation which improves efficiency of codes.
- Enforcing code styles and implementation which tries to maintain a clean codebase.
- Makes developing a large system less time expensive as it handles a lot of setups, configs and bottlenecks.
- Unlike some frameworks which tend to overcomplicate it's syntax, dolph.js tries to keep it as simple as possible.
- Enjoy out of the box support when working with the CLI tool.
- Use the same packages you use in your express.js codebase.
